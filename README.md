# Unphollowed on Twitter

A simple twitter bot that tells you about people who unfollowed you everyday.

## Wanna know who unfollows you?

Just mention @unphollowed and say "notify", the bot will start notifying you everyday about the people who unfollowed you.

eg: **@unphollowed _notify_**

## Don't wanna get notified anymore?

Just mention @unphollowed and say "stop".

eg: **@unphollowed _stop_**

## My resources are limited, so am I

1. I can't have users with more than 2500 followers.

2. I can't have more than 50 users at the point.

These limitations are temporary, and I'll try to extend them.
