# Unphollowed on Twitter

A simple twitter bot that tells you about people who unfollowed you everyday.

## Wanna know who unfollows you?

Just mention @unphollowed and say "notify", we'll start notifying you everyday about the people who unfollowed you.

eg: **@unphollowed _notify_**

## Don't wanna get notified anymore?

Just mention @unphollowed and say "stop".

eg: **@unphollowed _stop_**

## Our limitations

Our resources are limited, so are we..

1. We can't have users with more than 5000 followers.

2. We can't have more than 1000 users at the point.

These limitations are temporary, and we'll try to extend them.
